## Introduction

I faced two years of unemployment in my field as a young adult after I finished my studies. These are the lessons I've learned from my job-hunting experience, to help others avoid the same struggles and the same mistakes I've made.

During the last 5 years I created resumes for myself, friends, and family, applying what I knew to help me and others get jobs.

Along the way, I had to change my way of thinking, especially when things didn't work out as planned. I started asking myself: What makes a resume stand out? How can I make it better?

This led me through an endless cycle of chaos, anger, acceptance, and faith, until I finally found someone who believed in me and gave me a chance to prove myself in the field.

If you're currently facing a similar situation, and you're in that cycle, *keep reading!* I'm here to share some valuable lessons that could save you tons of time.

### Job Hunting is a Competition

You can't ignore the competition.

Whether you're building a product, a service, or a resume, thereâ€™s always someone else with a solution that's just as good, if not better.

The job market is no different. You have to ask yourself: What kind of profiles am I competing against for this job?

If there are thousands of junior programmers fighting for a handful of junior roles, how do you stand out from the rest?

After years of trial and error, **I believe it comes down to six key areas**:

1.  **Gaining relevant work experience (or creating it).**
2.  **Proficiency in the *right* tools.**
3.  **A portfolio of public personal projects.**
4.  **Excellent communication skills.**
5.  **A professional and trustworthy look.**
6.  **Mastering the first impression (both in-person and digital).**

### #1 - Gaining Relevant Experience (Even When You Have None)

Have you ever found yourself in the situation where you don't have experience, but you need experience for entry-level positions? Bad news! That's been the norm for a while.

There are different options to solve this, such as:

1.  **Certified courses ( which require $$$ )**
2.  **Personal projects** that can be showcased as applicable work experience.
3.  **Unpaid work or internships** related to the field, which count as real-world experience.

If you're broke just like I was, courses are clearly out of the question. But they are still something to take into consideration if you work a part time job.

For the average student who just got out of school, or a person who wants to get into the field starting from scratch, **getting a hold of work-applicable knowledge is something that must be taken as a personal endeavor.** It's not something that's given to you out of generosity at school. The harsh reality is that **school is not designed to teach you the technical skills applicable in today's market.**

The minimum requirements for most jobs nowadays surpass the teachings from high school and university by a long shot. (This is why the 3 options above are more worthy compared to classic education, practically speaking)

Regarding the second and third options, I've always found that interest and curiosity always leads to the best of things. if you're a creative mind, I'd suggest you just go for it and build multiple small, creative personal projects. If you're more of a structured person and you need someone to tell you what to do, you could look for unpaid work instead.

**Both are valid options**, and both require great mental power that's beyond the usual passive scroller. But this is the core of it, really. If you're feeling like this is a lot of work, well, that's because it is. **There's no easy option for standing out** unless you're the son of a millionaire.

### #2 - Choosing and Mastering the Right Tools

Proficiency is something that can only be achieved through experience, but since we've already covered that, let's discuss the choice of tools.

##### The Golden Rule

Adaptability and forward-thinking are always the best assets one can have. **Technologies always change,** and what is the norm now might not be the norm 12 months from now.

In other words, when someone is learning a new language for the first time, it's very hard at first. But once it's been absorbed, other similar languages are going to be way easier to learn.

##### My Personal Mistake

I've learned and used PHP for a long time since it's the #1 used language on the web, but the mistake I've made is that I didn't progress into studying something new soon enough. When I achieved enough experience in PHP, there were a lot less entry-level positions in my area that required legacy knowledge compared to more modern stacks of technology. That's when I did a speedrun to learn Vue and published this website :)

### #3 - Building a Portfolio of Personal Projects

Deciding what kind of project you want to make is up to you, but to someone who has never made one, this might help get you started:

##### Write it down on a piece of paper first

The design is the most important part of your project, even if no one will probably read it, making the hard choices at the beginning will save you from headaches later.

##### K.I.S.S (Keep it simple, Stupid)

Complexity is not linear; it's exponential. This means that the bigger the project becomes, the harder it will be to add new features (or remove/edit existing ones).

**A simple, finished project is infinitely more valuable than a complex, abandoned one.**

##### Set realistic goals

If you are the kind of person who is constant and is able to manage themselves to the finish line, great! but if you're not, let me tell you a story:

When I was still a teenager, I struggled to keep up with personal projects and often abandoned them. This kind of behavior was no longer sustainable. So  found some "smart" ways to force myself into doing things!

-   **Start small:** There's no point in making something big if you cannot finish it.
-   **Build a routine:** Two hours a day for five days is better than a whole day a week dedicated to the project.
-   **Don't lose momentum:** Never stop for more than a week, or you'll forget what you were doing and break the flow.
-   **Take care of yourself**: Sleep well, go to the gym - healthy mind in healthy body :)

### #4 - Communicating Your Value (Presentation is Everything)

You've finished the project and published it on GitHub. You're done now, right?

***Wrong!***

None of it matters if there's no presentation!

The #1 priority of a personal project should be its presentation, which is comprised of many small things:

-   Is there a comprehensive article about it written somewhere?
-   Does it feature a detailed README on GitHub?
-   Have you posted about it on any relevant forums?
-   Did you collaborate with other people?
-   Have you talked about it at a Tech Talk or meetup?
-   Do you have a personal website to present it in a more personalized way?

**The hard truth: it could be the coolest project in the history of mankind, but if you're unable to present it as worthy, it's worthless.**

My advice on this is to present your work with confidence. Don't show yourself as doubtful of your own work. Be truthful and honest about it, but don't let anyone downplay it and be prepared to "fight back" in a professional way.

Unfortunately, there will always be people who try to diminish your hard work. This is why communication is one of the most important soft skills you can develop, both at work and in life.

One last piece of advice: Always ask for feedback to enhance your presentation and professional persona further.

### #5 - Look and Professionalism

Remember this ancient proverb?

> "Don't judge a book by its cover"

or even better, in italian:

> "[L'abito non fa il monaco](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/l%27abito_non_fa_il_monaco)" which roughly translates to "[The cowl doesn't make the monk](https://www.inmsol.com/spanish-proverbs/the-cowl-does-not-make-the-monk/)"

We can all agree that it speaks wisdom, but that doesn't necessarily make it applicable to reality.

> In job hunting, the cover *makes* the book. The clothes *make* the monk. All that glitters is, in fact, gold.

In practical terms, this means paying attention to both your physical and digital presence. For example:

-   **In the physical world,** wear professional attire appropriate for the company culture you're interviewing with.
-   **In the digital world,** create a dedicated email address for work (e.g., `firstname.lastname@email.com`).
-   **Take time to embellish your LinkedIn profile.** A complete, professional profile acts as your digital business card.

### #6 - Mastering Your First Impression

A powerful first impression is about more than just your clothes. It's built on your manners, your posture, the way you sit, and your habit of thinking before you speak. **It's about presenting the best possible version of yourself.**

This isn't just for in-person meetings, either. Your first impression starts in the digital world. That's what a cover letter is for. It's the modern equivalent of a firm handshake and looking someone in the eye. This is probably the hardest skill to master, so start practicing now. Stand in front of a mirror or ask a friend for their honest feedback. :)

## Conclusion

So, what's the takeaway? Job hunting is a competition, and you need a strategy to win. **Don't just send out applications and hope for the best.** Focus on quality instead of quantity.

That cycle of chaos, anger, acceptance, and faith I mentioned at the beginning is real, and it's exhausting. But it doesn't have to be *endless*. Each project you finish, each interview you prepare for, and each connection you make is a step forward.

**This journey is a marathon, not a sprint.** Focus on what you can control: your skills, your presentation, and your mindset. **In the end, you will not only survive the competition, you will thrive in the hostile environment that is job hunting.**
