## Introduction

**Orobica Laser** is a local company in my area in northern Italy. I offered my assistance to make their website mobile responsive and up to date

The target audience of their services is mainly other local businesses (**B2B**), the purpose of the website is to show all their available services and funnel the business requests through a contact form or a phone call.

### What do they offer?

The company primarily offers various services of laser engraving, they stand out as artists of laser technology as they **pioneered their own techniques** for making unique products.

## Design

> The design part went a bit like this

Orobica Laser was not interested in getting too much recognition online as they fear to grow too much, rather preferring to stay small so that they don’t have to deal with “*too much work*” or “*growing too much*” so, respecting their preferences I kept the website very basic, deciding to not bloat it with marketing strategies like showing off numbers and showing satisfied customers reviews.

## Conclusion

The final result came out as a clean and user-friendly website that embraced the company vision of staying simple, it’s not only a digital presence but a pathway for potential clients to connect easier with Orobica Laser.

> Looking ahead, my hope is that one day they will choose to expand their online presence, until then my journey on web development will continue with other projects. Thank you for reading!
